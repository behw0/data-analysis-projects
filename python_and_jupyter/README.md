# Python Projects

This repository contains various data analysis and machine learning projects developed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each project showcases different techniques and libraries used for data processing, visualization, and machine learning.

## Projects

### 1. K-means Clustering for College Data
This project demonstrates the use of the K-means clustering algorithm to partition a dataset into distinct groups. For this project, we try to use KMeans Clustering to cluster universities into two groups: Private and Public.

#### Features:
- Initialization: Selection of initial centroids.
- Assignment: Assigning data points to the nearest centroid.
- Update: Recomputing the centroids based on the assigned data points.
- Iteration: Repeating the assignment and update steps until convergence.
- Visualization: Displaying the clusters and centroids on a 2D plot for analysis.

#### Technologies Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- KMeans from scikit-learn
