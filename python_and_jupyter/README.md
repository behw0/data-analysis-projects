## Projects Showcase

### 1. Call Center Sales Analysis
-   **Objective:** To analyze sales and operational metrics from a call center to identify top-performing products, sales trends, and areas for improvement.
-   **Description:** This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to answer key business questions related to sales performance.
-   **Key Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
-   **File:** `Call_Center_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`

### 2. Video Game Sales Analysis (1980-2017)
-   **Objective:** To uncover historical trends in the video game industry, analyzing which genres, platforms, and publishers have dominated the market over the decades.
-   **Description:** An in-depth exploratory analysis of a large dataset of video game sales. The project visualizes market share evolution, regional preferences, and top-selling titles.
-   **Key Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Plotly`, `Seaborn`.
-   **File:** `Video_Game_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`

### 3. K-means Clustering for College Data
-   **Objective:** To apply an unsupervised machine learning model to segment universities into two distinct groups (Private and Public) based on their features.
-   **Description:** This project serves as a practical introduction to clustering. It involves data preprocessing, model training with K-means, and evaluating the model's ability to distinguish between university types.
-   **Key Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Seaborn`.
